# GAN_Custom_Layers

The code was used to Kaggle Bronze Medal. 

The main idea behind doing this was to see, rather than using DCGAN/ACGAN, can custom layers GAN be used to generate artificial/synthetic images. 

The code shall work for New Dataset if you update the data folder to your custom data folder
